# Gomodoro

A Teeny-Tiny [Pomodoro](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pomodoro_Technique) Timer built using Golang

## Installation

This app doesn't require any specific instructions for compilation since it has no external dependencies; a regular `go build` will do the trick.

## Usage

Run the following command to start a timer for the required time for the `taskName` task:

``` ./gomodoro taskName -work 25m -rest 5.5m -reps 2 ```

- Enjoy the `r/aww` moments between your work!

This was just made on a whim roughly an hour ago, so feel free to suggest anything through appropriately labelled issues!
